# EDA-Relapse-Patients-Data-Analysis
## Problem statement
The challenge focuses on analysing the factors that affect the period of sober of the patient and as a result, predict the relapse period of the patients.<br>

## Domain Understanding
Relapse: (of a sick or injured person) deteriorate after a period of improvement. <br>

A relapse happens when a person stops maintaining their goal of reducing or avoiding use of alcohol or other drugs and returns to their previous levels of use.<br>

The patients undergo rehabilitation in camps to overcome their addiction and increase their period of sober.<br>

The prediction of the relapse period will help the medical expertise provide the appropriate treatment to the patient.<br>

Data comprises of patient's socioeconomic information including employment, education, income, marriage details, family details, alcohol and other addiction details.<br>
<br>
#### Graphical analysis can observed in the shared presentation.

## Conclusion
The dataset mainly concentrates on patients having agricultural background.<br>
The educational level was found to be maximum of level 3 that is, 8th, 9th and 10th.<br>
Majority of the patients had relapsed only once, that is 179 patients out of 203, this data was sampled for further analysis.<br>
One of the cause for patient's relapse  was identified to be poverty or severe debts which they confronted during their childhood/teenage and reason for indulging in alcoholism was due to someone amongst their family or friends who were alcoholics.<br>
Majority of the patients lie in the very high level risk of abv which was calculated based on the type of alcohol they had consumed and the average units consumed in the last 30 days.<br>
Patients were not involved in any other extracurricular activities such as sports etc which allowed them more leisure time to be involved in overconsumption.<br>
From the comparison between the AAO for alcohol in year and at what age they started working it was evident that they started consuming alcohol before they started working.<br>
From withdrawal symptoms we have identified that insomnia and tremors are the major symptoms faced by the patients when they decline having alcohol after a period.<br>
The twice relapsed patients who were in the critical period of sober of 0-15 had family history of alcoholism which could be a contributing factor towards their relapse and addiction.<br>
